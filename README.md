# Fast Food Convolutional Neural Network

A Tensorflow implemented convolution neural network for image classification of fast foods. The model was created and trained to identify if a given image is a hot dog, pizza or a burger. The dataset used contained 1130 images in total of images that was scraped from Google Images using google-images-download and is not included in this repository. The results of the training and validation are plotted on a graph to visualise the accuracy and loss. Finally, the model is tested with an image and outputs its confidence level for the class it is the most confident in the prediction.
