# Fast Food Convolutional Neural Network

A Tensorflow implemented convolution neural network for image classification of fast foods. The model was created and trained to identify if a given image is a hot dog, pizza or a burger. The dataset used contained 1130 images in total of images that was scraped from Google Images using google-images-download and is not included in this repository. The data was split with 80% used for training and 20% for the validation set. Due to the small dataset, data augmentations were applied including vertical and horizontal flips as well as rotations and zoom to increase the images available for training. The model includes three hidden layers each with a max pooling layer to further improve the training process. The results of the training and validation are plotted on a graph to visualise the accuracy and loss. Finally, the model is tested with an image and outputs its confidence level for the class it is the most confident in the prediction.
